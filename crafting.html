        <div class="CRINFO">When crafting the most essential item would be who guesses it, a crafting table. The crafting table is where most things are crafted although you can craft any 2 by 2 items in your inventory. A crafting table is made by four pieces of anytype of wood in a square, when crafting or in your inventory you will be able to access a crafting recipe book that will hold all crafting recipes available with the materials you have already found.

        <div class="CRAFTINGTABLE"></div>
        <div class="CRINFO">The crafting recipe book while very helpful also doesnâ€™t have all the recipes you might need so when that happens i would suggest just googling it. Another feature of the recipe book is that there are multiple sections, a search bar as well as a button in the corner which filters out all the recipes you don't have the materials for, to make finding specific recipes quick and easy.<br><br>There are multiple uncraftable items, for example: Chain mail armor, Enchanted golden apples, Music discs, nametags, saddles etc.. excluding the chainmail most of these items can be found in loot chests or they can sometimes be obtained by trading with villagers.</div>
