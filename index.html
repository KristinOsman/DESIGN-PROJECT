        <div class="HINFO1">This website was created with the purpose of being a guide for beginners or just a useful tool for those interested in minecraft, so I will only really be covering the basics. A short disclaimer, I created this website with the Java edition of minecraft in mind so it may be possible that some of this information doesn’t transfer over to the bedrock edition of the game. But i'm sure that even if you play minecraft bedrock this guide can be of help to you.<br><br>This guide was created near the release of the 1.18 Caves and Cliffs update. </div>

        <div class="HINFO1">Minecraft is a sandbox game which essentially means that you are free to do whatever you like using different settings like creative mode, spectator mode, adventure mode, and survival mode you can create to your heart's desire. The game does have an “ending” which would be defeating the ender dragon but don’t worry even if you defeat the ender dragon there is still much more left for you to discover and do.<br><br>With that out of the way feel free to browse topics that you may need guidance in or just as references for future use.</div>
