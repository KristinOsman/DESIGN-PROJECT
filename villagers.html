        <!--VILLAGERS INFO-->
        <div class="VINFO1">Villagers are a great way to advance your minecraft world, you can use them to trade for various rare and useful items, as well as an easy source of exp. There are multiple types of villagers each with a specific aesonal of trades available but some of the most useful would be the librarian which needs a lectern, the fletcher which needs a fletching table, and the carpenter which needs a cartography table. The librarian trades for enchanted books which can be used in an anvil and both the fletcher and carpenter are easy ways to acquire emeralds which tend to appear in most villager trades.<br><br>When creating your own villager trading hall the most important steps are to capture two villagers in a place where they wouldn’t be able to escape while still giving them space, place at least two beds in the space, then throw bread at them so that they can breed. When you have as many villagers as you desire you can start placing down workstation blocks, these blocks are how villagers are assigned to their jobs. Villagers won't get a job when it is night or when they are wearing green.

        <div class="VINFO2">If you gave a villager a certain job and you didn’t like the trade they were offering you, you could just mine the workstation block and replace it to get a different trade. But once you have traded for at least one item with that villager their trades will never change, not even if you delete their workstation block.<br><br>If you trade enough with a villager their trades will start to evolve, giving new trades specific to their rank. Also when you trade with a villager enough times for the same item they will run out of stock, but don’t worry if there is a workstation block related to their job nearby then it will replenish overtime.<br><br><span class="big">Here is a chart for the different types of villager jobs and their workstation blocks:</span>
